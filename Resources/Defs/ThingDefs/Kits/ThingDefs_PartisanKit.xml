		<defName>BNF_Headgear_SlouchHat</defName>
		<label>Slouch Hat</label>
		<description>Based on an Old Earth design from the 3rd Era of Imperialism. This headgear is designed to protect the wearer from the worst heat they can find in the Rim. Providing not only cool headwear but also protecting the wearer from the worst that the sun can provide. Originally designed for usage on Spiceworld Regiments, it is now found in more worlds than the uniform that it came from.</description>

Before the mechanoid threat, separatists groups armed themselves with this ancient design. After centuries of fighting the Domain, the Bugs, and the Bots, the design has been further streamlined. parts made with polymers or woods changes to shaped steel, fine crafted metal turned to mass production stamps, and quality turned to quantity.

		<description>Originally an ancient design from the Inter-Humanity Wars, now finds new life in the Rim. When warfare eventually fell into stagnation and trenches, this ancient weapon was again found in the hands of those in the trenches. Often hand-made by Army Blacksmiths, they come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials yet this design is the most popular. Unlike many weapons though, this one still found use against Insectoids. The spike blade would easily penetrate the chitin of an Insectoid and many veterans found themselves brave enough to do so.</description>
