				<loreDesc>The most important part of any army is the ability to acquire intelligence on their enemies. The Vanguard Carapace Armor was designed on several planets though the most famous and its namesake would be by the Alexandrian Vanguard. During the First War of Alexandria against the Mechanoids, the most important factor in combat was speed. While not being heavy standard Carapace Armor is bulky and could be lightened. The Vanguard did so through removal of the shoulder plates and the “shaving” of certain areas until it only protected the chest of the wearer.</loreDesc>
				<vanillaDesc>A lighter variant of carapace armor that sacrifices protection for mobility. Shoulder plating is removed and chest coverage reduced to cut weight. Favored by scouts who need speed and maneuverability over full defense.</vanillaDesc>

				<loreDesc>Justice is a concept that defies the colonial experience. Lawlessness is anathema to the civlization being brought to the Rimworlds by the expeditions. Justice now comes in a convient belt form which allows them to subdue, pacify, and protect your families from all threats foreign. Despite your utter lack of real skills and borderline to actual psychopathy, you can use physical violence to gain the respect of the community. Also, the body cams were smashed before you go your belt so there is no recording to submit to evidence during your brutality trial.</loreDesc>
				<vanillaDesc>A copy of the common carapace armor that uses leather instead of metals. A lightweight piece of armor which is more effective being used by law enforcement than on the front lines. Though made from leather, it still has an identifier of a member of law enforcement.</vanillaDesc>

		<label>Psycher Staff</label>
		<description>Originally an ancient design from the Inter-Humanity Wars, now finds new life in the Rim. When warfare eventually fell into stagnation and trenches, this ancient weapon was again found in the hands of those in the trenches. Often hand-made by Army Blacksmiths, they come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials yet this design is the most popular. Unlike many weapons though, this one still found use against Insectoids. The spike blade would easily penetrate the chitin of an Insectoid and many veterans found themselves brave enough to do so.</description>
