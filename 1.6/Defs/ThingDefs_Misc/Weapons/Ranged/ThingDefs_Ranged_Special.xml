		<description>An example of the steppingstone between chemical ballistic and magnet ballistic weaponry. A solid ferrous bullet is fired through barrel surrounded by magnetic field generating rails, pushing the bullet far past the speed of sound. Sounds like a genius idea, essentially doubling the life span and abilities of any gunpowder firearm through simple upgrade. Turns out that conversion Chem-Rail Rifles have half the lifespan of purpose-built Chem-Rail Rifles, this was by design so the company could sell more guns they produced rather than just selling conversion kits. Of course, they were eventually blown out of the market by Charge weapons, leaving only the aftermarket for many of these guns as their creator company is now playing catch-up.\n\nOfficial Name: Alphamech Gustav Mod.10 Chemical Assisted Railgun "Chem-Rail."</description>

		<description>Considered an older brother to the Super-Shotgun, the Twin-Lancer Rifle was designed as a anti-Mechanoid weapon. The Two barrels provided a means to easily take down mechanoids with two hypervelocity anti-armor rounds piercing within miliseconds of each other. This provided effective on the world of Okeus, where the locals of the world had developed the rifle at first to hunt their local fauna such as the razorbacks and the stonetossers. These animals had natural armor which made conventional weapons unusable. So they developed the Twin-Lancer which provided a perfect weapon when the Mechfleet 781 arrived. A simple change allowed the weapon to serve as well against Mechanoids as it did the armorered fauna, now the weapon is found anywhere where it can work.\n\nOfficial Name: Okeus Manufacturing Concern OMC-2 Double Rifle.</description>
