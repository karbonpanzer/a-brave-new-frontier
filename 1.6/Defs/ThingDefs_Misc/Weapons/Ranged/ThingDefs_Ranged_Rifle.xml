		<description>Nostalgia is a hell of a thing. People appreciate a classic or at least the idea of a classic, so many companies put our various “retro” themed weaponry. The “Retro” Weapon market leads to many interesting designs that feel old but are in fact very new. This model being built of a famous weapon used centuries ago during humanity’s Dark Age. Though not a direct copy this imitation still sells well enough and maintains enough aspects of the original that many don’t notice the difference. Often found in the hands of the middle-class mercenary or with people who assumed this would be more useful than a classic car on the Rim.\n\n Millenia Model 0 "The Classica."</description>

		<description>A relatively new weapon in comparison to many of its compatriots on the Rim. The Hyperblaster was one of the first charge weapons created during the Human-Mechanoid Wars and it shows. Heavy, clumsy, but packs more wallop than modern Charge weapons due to its very unrefined abilities. These traits are the reason it is called the Hyperblaster rather than its official name or even the other names given to it like Siegebreaker and Quakemaker.

Creiddylad is home to the Gamma Breeder, a mutant form of the Insectoid Queens which seems to give birth to legions of insects much quicker than other hives. This has lead to the Creiddylad cities of Gwythyr and Gwyn to form the great bulwark against the Insectoids. At the front of it is the Assault LMG, one of the fastest firing weapons that humanity creates, providing a leaden deterant against insectoids. It was made after partial records of past humanity which allowed them to design a weapon which provided speed and power, though modifications created a inaccurate weapon.\n\nOfficial Name: Gywdthur M-311 Offensive Machine Gun.</description>

				<LoreDesc>On the warworld of Creiddylad, the Assault LMG serves as a reminder of the sheer viciousness of the Insectoids. Creiddylad is home to the Gamma Breeder, a mutant form of the Insectoid Queens which seems to give birth to legions of insects much quicker than other hives. This has lead to the Creiddylad cities of Gwythyr and Gwyn to form the great bulwark against the Insectoids. At the front of it is the Assault LMG, one of the fastest firing weapons that humanity creates, providing a leaden deterant against insectoids. It was made after partial records of past humanity which allowed them to design a weapon which provided speed and power, though modifications created a inaccurate weapon.\n\nOfficial Name: Gywdthur M-311 Offensive Machine Gun.</LoreDesc>
				<VanillaDesc>A compact belt-fed squad support gun. Fires long, fast bursts for heavy suppression. Very effective at medium range but inaccurate and burns through ammunition.</VanillaDesc>

		  <label>phase rifle</label>
		  <description>Designed by the Alphamech Spacer Initiative as a weapon against Mechanoids in space, it favored a non-traditional design. A bull-pup shocker rifle which fires phased electric projectiles instead of the traditional chemical ballistic. Many expedition efforts prefer this for their orbital fleets for the sheer logistics, all Alphamech shocker weapons use the Alphamech standard battery. The ease of recharging these weapons allows even the most isolated worlds can use this weapon effectively, some worlds hold phase rifles that are centuries old running off of the same battery. However, the firepower of this rifle did not meet standards when it came to anti-Mechanoid combat, however a single modification allowed this to work.\n\nIt was then equiped with an Alphamech Jupiter-25 EMP Launcher which was found to increase the anti-mechanoid combat effectiveness by 30%. Though some have modified the launcher to fill other rolls but none have arrived here, so many just blow themselves up.\n\nOfficial Name: Alphamech Apollo-97 Phase Action Offensive Weapon System with Jupiter-25 EMP Launcher.</description>
