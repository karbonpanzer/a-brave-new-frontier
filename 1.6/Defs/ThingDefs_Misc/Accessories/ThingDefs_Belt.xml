		<description>For centuries, the Infantry of the Great Domain served with the essentials needed to fight. Several ammo pouches that can be configured for both magazines and loss ammo, a canteen, and a knife or bayonet which serve as both weapon and utility for those in the infantry. Though coming in many configurations, this variant was the most popular and thus the most widespread.</description>

		<description>Justice is a concept that defies the colonial experience. Lawlessness is anathema to the civlization being brought to the Rimworlds by the expeditions. Justice now comes in a convient belt form which allows them to subdue, pacify, and protect your families from all threats foreign. Despite your utter lack of real skills and borderline to actual psychopathy, you can use physical violence to gain the respect of the community. Also, the body cams were smashed before you go your belt so there is no recording to submit to evidence during your brutality trial.</description>
