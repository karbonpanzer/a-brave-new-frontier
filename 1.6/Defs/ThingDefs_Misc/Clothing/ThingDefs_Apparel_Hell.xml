		<description>Some worlds within the great domain were not made for life, such as the Spiceworlds, who great produced the addictions of the domain's courts. The hellish worlds rose to such high temperatures that the presence of water was considered an anomaly. However the desire for the drugs of which the Spiceworlds produced drove humanity into hell itself. Rather than loose clothing like many desert cultures, the Torrid uniform uses a series of chemical bladders filled with a liquid compound which generates a pleasent cold in the hot environments. Some coats in the past have malfunctioned, leading some to freeze to death in the desert.</description>
