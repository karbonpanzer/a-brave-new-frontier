		<label>Frontier Uniform (Polar)</label>
		<description>While many worlds in the Great Domain were settled for the resources they provided for the whole of humanity, during the Final War many less habitable planets were being occupied. These worlds became the first Fortressworlds, planets dedicated to holding the line against the Mechs and the Bugs. This uniform is heavily modified from the original template, featuring a mesh heating network powered by dead skin cells.  This keeps the wearer warm in the coldest of environments without stressing any infrastructure on a planet. Though the methods of creating such a uniform are a significantly more complex process, though worth it for the cold.</description>

		<label>Field Hat (Polar)</label>
		<description>Though a similar design to other cold weather gear, this one is more than it appears. This headwear features the same mesh heating network as the Polar Uniform, though with a few modifications, mainly it can be powered by both dead skin cells and shed hair to ensure comfortable warmth during the coldest of environments. Much like its companion piece, this one requires additional research for it to be produced.</description>
