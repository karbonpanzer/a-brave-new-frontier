		<label>Frontier Uniform (Boreal)</label>
		<description>As the Great Domain expanded its borders, it found itself settling on worlds that provided a harder living than what many were used too. On the coldest worlds of Rim, this is a common sight. Dense textiles mixed with wool and composite fibers that allow a certain level of warmth without creating discomfort. This design still remains top of the line on many worlds due to the simplicity of the design and the ease of creation. Even now many paramilitaries are using this uniform and see no reason to replace or even redesign them, a time-tested design from the Old World.</description>

		<label>Field Hat (Boreal)</label>
		<description>Like many of the Great Domain’s designs, this one is based on the headwear of the warriors of Old Earth. A fur lined headwear designed to keep the wearer warm, other than that it is a very basic design. Such simplicity was the reason for its usage by the Great Domain, its simplicity allowed it to be constructed in even the most barren of environments, though like many things some are better than others.</description>
