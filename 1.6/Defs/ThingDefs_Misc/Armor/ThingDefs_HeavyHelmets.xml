    <label>Heavy Carapace Helmet</label>
    <description>An improvement in the previous design of Carapace Helmets though never popularly adopted due to the Fall of the Great Domain.  Providing great protection without becoming cumbersome, the Heavy Carapace Helmet is now stronger and more durable without sacrificing comfort for protection. This was achieved through advancements in plasteel plating, providing greater protection without adding too much weight. Though lacking the larger stores of its lighter brethren, the Heavy Carapace Helmet has become more popular with heavy infantry and shocktrooper regiments throughout the Rim.</description>

    <description>The greatest battle after the fall of the Great Domain was the seven battles of Deirdre, the last of the Coreworlds to fall. For over 200 years, the planet of Deirdre was assaulted by the Insectoid and Mechanoid forces which saw the once beautiful planet become a Deathworld. The Domain Honor Guard eventually falling into despair and reorganizing into the Company of Sorrows, determined to keep the planet free. This helmet is a testament to that, a reinforced faceshield to ensure that soldiers who often fought in both ranged and melee could be protected against all threats.</description>

        <LoreDesc>Based on an ancient design of headwear, this helmet was designed for usage during Attrition Warfare. From the most brutal of trenches this helmet protects from Carapace and shrapnel that often finds soldiers in the trenches. Though lacking the finer details of more modern designs it makes up for it through the ease of production of this helmet. Its composition allows a versatile usage, being made from a composite of plasteel and a base metal that ensures even soldiers on the most barren of worlds will have adequate protection from their enemies.</LoreDesc>
