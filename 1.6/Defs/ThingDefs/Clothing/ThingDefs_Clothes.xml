		<description>From the dense jungles to the dry deserts, this uniform is designed to be proficient at both. While being made from common textiles, it retains a composition that allows a high level of comfort in any form of heat. This was initially used on the Spiceworlds of the Great Domain, the planets themselves being low static desert worlds perfect to produce advanced circuitry needed for the first generation of Mechanoids.

		<description>As the Great Domain expanded its borders, it found itself settling on worlds that provided a harder living than what many were used too. On the coldest worlds of Rim, this is a common sight. Dense textiles mixed with wool and composite fibers that allow a certain level of warmth without creating discomfort.

		<description>While the Officer Uniform is a strong contender for a perfect uniform for the Rim, it has come up short in one aspect, the cold. In polar environments the Officer uniform fails to maintain a warm temperature for the wearer. The solution was simple, a modified form of the mesh heating network found in the Polar Uniforms that now functions off a kinetic battery which was more effective due to the layers of the uniform.
