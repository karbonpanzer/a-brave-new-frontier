		<description>From the dense jungles to the dry deserts, this uniform is designed to be proficient at both. While being made from common textiles, it retains a composition that allows a high level of comfort in any form of heat. This was initially used on the Spiceworlds of the Great Domain, the planets themselves being low static desert worlds perfect to produce advanced circuitry needed for the first generation of Mechanoids. While the Great Domain has fallen, this uniforms remains as a memory of a time long past, when humanity dominated all worlds they encountered.</description>

		<description>This was the first symbol of the Great Domain, a uniform designed not for the perils of the Rim. Instead, this uniform was the symbol of the expansion of humanity, as it was these worlds that settled the New Earths.
