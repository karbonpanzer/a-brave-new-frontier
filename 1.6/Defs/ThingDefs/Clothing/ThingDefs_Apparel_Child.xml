		<description>This was the first symbol of the Great Domain, a uniform designed not for the perils of the Rim. Instead, this uniform was the symbol of the expansion of humanity, as it was these worlds that settled the New Earths. The planets that were closest in composition to Earth that made them ripe for settlement in the early years. Perfect for the temperate environments that were common on Earth which are now finding usage on the more palatable Rimworlds. The popularity of this uniform is still found after centuries of usage, even outside of military organizations.</description>
