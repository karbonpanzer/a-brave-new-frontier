		<label>Frontier Officer Uniform</label>
		<description>Distinction is an important aspect of an army, from the hero of the ancient world to the home-grown heroes. This uniform serves as a symbol of that distinction, a heavy coat designed with comfort and protection in mind, comfortable in both hot and cold though costly to produce. Such was the case for the Great Domain that this uniform is rarely seen outside of professional armies, often in the hands of remnant armies of the Great Domain. Though its rarity does not prohibit its usage, it is still found even among the most remote worlds of the Rim.</description>

		<label>Frontier Officer Uniform (Polar)</label>
		<description>While the Officer Uniform is a strong contender for a perfect uniform for the Rim, it has come up short in one aspect, the cold. In polar environments the Officer uniform fails to maintain a warm temperature for the wearer. The solution was simple, a modified form of the mesh heating network found in the Polar Uniforms that now functions off a kinetic battery which was more effective due to the layers of the uniform. Though issues have still arisen with this variant, many prefer faulty item that can work rather than hoping for something else to keep them warm.</description>
