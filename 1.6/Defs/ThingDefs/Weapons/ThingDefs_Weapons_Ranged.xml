		<description>Nostalgia is a hell of a thing. People appreciate a classic or at least the idea of a classic, so many companies put our various “retro” themed weaponry. The “Retro” Weapon market leads to many interesting designs that feel old but are in fact very new. This model being built of a famous weapon used centuries ago during humanity’s Dark Age. Though not a direct copy this imitation still sells well enough and maintains enough aspects of the original that many don’t notice the difference. Often found in the hands of the middle-class mercenary or with people who assumed this would be more useful than a classic car on the Rim.</description>

		<label>Heavy "Autoloader" Rifle</label>
		<description>The Last of the ill-fated “Autoloader” series of rifles, designed in the furnaces of Warworlds during the Inter-Humanity Wars. A 16.5MM Light Cannon was seen as the pinnacle of the Assault Rifle genus, it easily penetrated Human made armor and even capable of disabling light vehicles and aircraft. The massive flaw of this weapon though was weight, light cannons are in fact not light, and these weapons often were used less and less when the Mechanoid threat arrived. Though capable of killing Mechanoids and Insectoids easily, they fell to the wayside when Charge Based Weaponry came into play. An effective alternative to Assault Rifles and Charge Rifles, that is if you can carry it.</description>

		<label>Super-Shotgun</label>
		<description>The name much like the gun was a marketing ploy to get people to buy this unorthodox shotgun. A double barrel pulse action shotgun firing 10 gauge using an experimental caseless ammo system. The main selling point was with two barrels and two tubes, you can have one barrel firing shot from an unrifled barrel while the other fires slugs from a rifled barrel. A cute concept though not groundbreaking. It sold enough to keep the company afloat, but it went gangbusters when Mechanoids invaded. The gun was configured to fire explosive shells and EMP slugs, to counter Mechanoids with shields, though most people like the versatility of shot. Unlike other weapons, this isn’t surplus, its part of expanding the market.</description>

		<description>The Last Remnant of the Inter-Humanity Wars. Built on the idea of an “Offensive Pistol” for Trench Raiders on worlds consumed by conflicts, good for penetrating human made armor. When the Mechanoids emerged, that concept fell apart with the failure of these pistols to easily penetrate Mechanoid armor. Their use would continue against Insectoids, but the low magazine capacity would leave this pistol in the dust compared to its competitors. Obsolescence would usually leave guns in the hands of gang members and the Third-Worlders but not the Assault Pistol.

With the success of this project, they began to sell the gun to any organization that could afford it.

		<description>An example of the steppingstone between chemical ballistic and magnet ballistic weaponry.

Sounds like a genius idea, essentially doubling the life span and abilities of any gunpowder firearm through simple upgrade. Turns out that conversion Chem-Rail Rifles have half the lifespan of purpose-built Chem-Rail Rifles, this was by design so the company could sell more guns they produced rather than just selling conversion kits. Of course, they were eventually blown out of the market by Charge weapons, leaving only the aftermarket for many of these guns as their creator company is now playing catch-up.</description>

				<loreDesc>An ancient design from the pre-Great Domain era of humanity, this revolver was not designed for usage on worlds but in space as a vacuum weapon. While firearms do work in space they lack many things which would have made them optimal for usage, so the Slab Revolver was designed. A massive frame revolver that took .50 caliber micro-rockets with explosive tipped heads, designed with zero g in mind, they added as much weight to the weapon to make it have the same feel as holding a regular revolver in usual gravity. Though space combat is rare for infantry, this weapon has found its home among raiders in the Rimworlds in both space and surface, who enjoy its devastation potential for maiming the enemy even when directly missing them.</loreDesc>

Sisu is a fortressworld on the very edge of the Coreworlds, it is here where the longest single war in human history has occured, the War of Sisu, which has raged for 1,371 years. The world has fought not against the mechanoids or insectoids, but against the Black King, a rogue AI which used an army of clones made for the conquest of the stars during the Great Domain Era. The Black King has ground his forces against the Sisunians for centuries with few gains. This rifle was designed to fight humans who lack armor and in this aspect it functions very well, shredding flesh with ease. The design has been exported throughout the Rimworlds, with many adopting them for defensive weapons.</loreDesc>

				<loreDesc>Considered an older brother to the Super-Shotgun, the Twin-Lancer Rifle was designed as a anti-Mechanoid weapon. The Two barrels provided a means to easily take down mechanoids with two hypervelocity anti-armor rounds piercing within miliseconds of each other. This provided effective on the world of Okeus, where the locals of the world had developed the rifle at first to hunt their local fauna such as the razorbacks and the stonetossers. These animals had natural armor which made conventional weapons unusable. So they developed the Twin-Lancer which provided a perfect weapon when the Mechfleet 781 arrived. A simple change allowed the weapon to serve as well against Mechanoids as it did the armorered fauna, now the weapon is found anywhere where it can work.</loreDesc>
