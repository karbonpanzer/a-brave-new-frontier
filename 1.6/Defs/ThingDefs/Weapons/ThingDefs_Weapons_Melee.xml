		<description>Originally an ancient design from the Inter-Humanity Wars, now finds new life in the Rim. When warfare eventually fell into stagnation and trenches, this ancient weapon was again found in the hands of those in the trenches. Often hand-made by Army Blacksmiths, they come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials yet this design is the most popular. Unlike many weapons though, this one still found use against Insectoids. The spike blade would easily penetrate the chitin of an Insectoid and many veterans found themselves brave enough to do so.</description>

		<description>On the world Eku, during the fall of the Great Domain many found themselves under attack by the Mechanoids. Eku was not a frontier world, instead it had been settled centuries before by a movement of neo-Luddites seeking a closer harmony with nature. In the 42nd centuries after centuries of peace, they were invaded by the 9th Tetramid Fleet, forcing their world into a war they could not fight. Eventually a group of warriors emerged called the Stalkers, a sect of an order which developed this weapon with the goal of not only fighting Mechanoids but breaking them. A reinforced glaive with EMP emitters integrated into the blade which not only cuts through flesh and steel but can disable Mechanoids temporarily.</description>

On this brutal world the forces of the Crimson Guard, a army of revolutionary soldiers in service to the state have fought against the Omega Hivefleet. Vasilevsky is not a kind world, a frozen wasteland barring the habitable ring on the worlds equator which makes up the Great City of Vasilygrad. Vasilevsky was one of the few worlds to rebel and become independent of the Great Domain, however their freedom shortlived as only a few centuries later they would come under the threat of the insectoids. This weapon was their solution, rather than a conventional blade, using a chainsaw as a base to carve through chitin and guts, gaining it popularity with its brutality.  </loreDesc>

Few records exist of its creator, the Pirate Queen Myreth the Voidstar, all that is know is that she wielded a hammer made from a primitive grav-core engine. This grav-core allowed her to wield that hammer effortlessly by maniuplating gravity around it to make it light but when swung applies several atmospeheres of gravity onto its target. The name Crusher-Hammer comes from the flaw that many who have created the weapon come across, a grav-core failure can cause the user to be caught in its field and crushed instantly.</loreDesc>
