		<label>Slouch Hat</label>
		<description>Based on an ancient Earth tradition, the slouch hat is famous among some of humanities greatest warriors or at least their maddest. The hat originally saw use with the doomed Colonial Rangers, a paramilitary organization that fought rough nations and criminal empires in the Rimworlds before the Awakening. Faced with the insurmountable enemy of both the Mechanoids and Insectoids, the Colonial Rangers collapsed, now nothing more than a few rag tag partisan groups. Now it is found in the hands of collectors of curiosities or in people wanting to invoke an image of heroism without having any of that heroism.</description>

		<description>The most important part of any army is the ability to acquire intelligence on their enemies. The Vanguard Carapace Armor was designed on several planets though the most famous and its namesake would be by the Alexandrian Vanguard. During the First War of Alexandria against the Mechanoids, the most important factor in combat was speed. While not being heavy standard Carapace Armor is bulky and could be lightened. The Vanguard did so through removal of the shoulder plates and the “shaving” of certain areas until it only protected the chest of the wearer.\n\n This variant is marked with a skull, commonly seen among partisans.</description>
