		<label>Carapace Greaves</label>
		<description>The initial run of Carapace Armor often had protection for the thighs of soldiers but did not protect the leg from the knee down. This was chosen because of the need to keep soldiers mobile and moving fast. After decades of fighting Mechanoids and Insectoids in addition to humanity, the battle-smiths of the planet of Hastings created the Carapace Greaves. Built to the same standard of Carapace Armor, which allows protection but has the trade-off of heavy equipment slowing down soldiers, though the Dragonguard of Hastings preferred the heavy armor over nothing.</description>

		<description>Originally the Carapace Armor system did not include armor for hands. Many soldiers often complained about the lack of dexterity when handling their equipment, which left many of these gauntlets abandoned on the battlefields. Though when armies found themselves fighting the Insectoids during the War for Ramaal, many soldiers found the additional armor beneficial after seeing many of their allies dismembered. Bulky, cumbersome, and heavy, these gauntlets provide a level of protection that has kept many soldiers safe.</description>
