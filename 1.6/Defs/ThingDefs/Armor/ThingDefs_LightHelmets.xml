		<description>Heavy fighting is a constant, especially on the Hellworld of Acheron. For the last 400 years, Acheron has fought off the Gamma Incursion of Insectoids which have covered approximately 40% of the planet in a new terraformed landscape. This mask covers a variety of issues that would be found in the trenches of Acheron, from additional face protection and fabric keeping ash and spores out of the lungs of the Paladin Regiments. Functional and practical, with only a small amount of plasteel to provide protection from any projectile coming towards the wearer.</description>
