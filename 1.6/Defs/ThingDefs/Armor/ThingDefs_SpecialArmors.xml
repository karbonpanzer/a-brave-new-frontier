		<label>Officer Carapace Armor</label>
		<description>Carapace Armor comes in many shapes and sizes, this variant however was designed in the factories of the Deathworld of Fury. Despite the name, Fury is a highly organized society with a caste system which maintains a highborn nobility and a lowborn servile class. Often under siege by the Insectoid fleets, the Furian Guard is subject to the same stratification as their cities. As the Officers of the Furian Guard are found among the nobility, they have access to this specific armor. Reinforced with additional plasteel and adorned with gold filagree which offers both protection and proof of status.</description>

		<description>The most important part of any army is the ability to acquire intelligence on their enemies. The Vanguard Carapace Armor was designed on several planets though the most famous and its namesake would be by the Alexandrian Vanguard. During the First War of Alexandria against the Mechanoids, the most important factor in combat was speed. While not being heavy standard Carapace Armor is bulky and could be lightened. The Vanguard did so through removal of the shoulder plates and the “shaving” of certain areas until it only protected the chest of the wearer.</description>

		<description>Based on the ancient warriors of Old Earth, the Centurions of the Holyworld of Sabbath are an elite force of warriors. Quick, decisive, and often brutal, the Centurions of Sabbath have served as the last line of defense for the Beaconist Holyworld. Often this armor is found in Rimworlds are from the Heralds of Sabbath, Centurion forces sent to recover Beaconist relics to further their quest for the source. As with the tradition of Centurions, they often serve as officers of a squad of lesser legionaries though the position is filled with veneration.</description>

		<label>Carapace Greaves</label>
		<description>The initial run of Carapace Armor often had protection for the thighs of soldiers but did not protect the leg from the knee down. This was chosen because of the need to keep soldiers mobile and moving fast. After decades of fighting Mechanoids and Insectoids in addition to humanity, the battle-smiths of the planet of Hastings created the Carapace Greaves. Built to the same standard of Carapace Armor, which allows protection but has the trade-off of heavy equipment slowing down soldiers, though the Dragonguard of Hastings preferred the heavy armor over nothing.</description>
