        <baseDesc>After the colonization of their world, [PAWN_nameDef] sought to fight an indirect war against their colonizer. Learning the construction of traps and various weapons, [PAWN_pronoun] used this knowledge to hamper and even cripple several efforts of colonist groups which seek the extermination of [PAWN_possessive] people.</baseDesc>

        <baseDesc>With the influx of colonists, many have forgotten the old ways. [PAWN_nameDef], however, has preserved the history of [PAWN_possessive] people in the oral tradition. All great heroes and villains, all golden ages and collapses, all remembered by [PAWN_objective] in speech and sound and poem. [PAWN_pronoun] preserves [PAWN_possessive] people, for those who have come to claim their world will not.</baseDesc>

        <baseDesc>Who won the lottery!? [PAWN_nameDef] did! [PAWN_pronoun] won an all-expenses-paid trip to the Rimworlds at the very edges of civilization. Going from a boring clerk to the frontier of adventure, though one small issue remains: [PAWN_pronoun] has very few skills that are useful in the Rimworlds. [PAWN_pronoun] likely has a future of hauling things and cleaning floors, but it’s still more interesting than spreadsheets.</baseDesc>

[PAWN_pronoun] fled to the Rimworld to avoid the purges, and now [PAWN_pronoun] lives every day feeling worse about the galaxy than before.</baseDesc>

        <baseDesc>Trained since childhood as a stone mason, [PAWN_nameDef] was sent for by a colonial governor to construct a mountain villa. A masterful structure was completed in record time, but when [PAWN_pronoun] sought payment for [PAWN_possessive] work, the governor ordered [PAWN_objective] arrested for daring to ask to be paid. They never caught [PAWN_objective], though — the villa was destroyed when insectoids burrowed into it, killing everyone inside.</baseDesc>
