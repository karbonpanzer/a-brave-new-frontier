	  <baseDesc>Soil keeps its memories in roots and rot. [PAWN_nameDef] spent years coaxing life from dead colonies, watching plants thrive where their owners starved. Each contract ended the same way — crops alive, pay withheld, ships gone. The Rim grows what it wants, and [PAWN_pronoun] learned to follow its seasons instead of signatures.</baseDesc>

	  <baseDesc>Maps were written one footprint at a time. [PAWN_nameDef] scouted ahead of caravans, marked water and shelter, and learned that getting paid required living long enough to report back. The corporations left, but the trails remained. On the Rim, the compass still points toward somewhere no one else has been.</baseDesc>

	  <baseDesc>Every border was a chance to lie for a living. [PAWN_nameDef] ferried cargo through forgotten routes, bribing officers and dodging scanners until the map itself became contraband. When a partner sold the coordinates, [PAWN_pronoun] vanished with the ship. The Rim has no customs and plenty of demand for silence.</baseDesc>
