    <baseDesc>Before joining the colony, [PAWN_nameDef] lived alone on the frontier, tracking smugglers and beasts across dust plains and frozen ridges. [PAWN_pronoun] learned to read weather, wind, and footprints better than faces. Years of silence made [PAWN_pronoun] wary of crowds but unmatched in survival instinct.</baseDesc>

    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] spent years beneath the earth, carving tunnels under enemy lines and setting shaped charges. The constant rumble of artillery became background noise. When peace came, [PAWN_pronoun] still built foxholes before sleeping — just in case.</baseDesc>

	  <baseDesc>Every bullet, every bandage - [PAWN_nameDef] knew where it came from and where it was going. Years in logistics turned [PAWN_pronoun] into a walking inventory, but that precision never left room for patience. When things went missing, someone always paid for it.</baseDesc>

    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] could turn scrap metal into a working rifle faster than most could find the safety switch. In the regiment’s armory, [PAWN_pronoun] built weapons out of boredom and repaired them out of habit. Noise didn’t bother [PAWN_objective]; people did.</baseDesc>

    <baseDesc>Settlements rose and fell under [PAWN_nameDef]’s hands. From crude barricades to geothermal plants, [PAWN_pronoun] built them all. The work was loud and dangerous — just how [PAWN_pronoun] liked it. Talking wasn’t part of the job description.</baseDesc>
