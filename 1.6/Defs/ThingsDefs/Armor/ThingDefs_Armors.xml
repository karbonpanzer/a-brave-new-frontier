    <description>Before the fall of the Coreworlds, the many armies of the Great Domain saw many servicemen divided into two groups, the Infantry and the Veterancy. While the Infantry was made up of various people from all walks of life, the Veterancy came from ancient nobility and were enhanced mechanically and biologically. This is the equipment of the Infantry, cheap and effective armor based on a plasteel framework with steel reinforcements to ensure an effective armor while being easy to produce compared to the Power Armor of the Veterancy. Its popularity remains after several centuries of usage</description>

    <label>Heavy Carapace Armor</label>
    <description>While Carapace Armor is better than flak vests and jackets, it does seem to lack a defense against charge weaponry and heavy munitions. An easier solution would be to equip all soldiers in the infantry with semi-powered armor but that is easier said than done. The end decision of this issue eventually became reinforcing the Carapace Armor with additional plates of plasteel to enhance its defensive abilities. The Heavy Carapace Armor was introduced during the Battle of Coldharbour after the Fall of the Great Domain to mixed success.</description>

        <vanillaDesc>While Carapace Armor is better than flak vests and jackets, it does seem to lack a defense against charge weaponry and heavy munitions. An easier solution would be to equip all soldiers in the infantry with semi-powered armor but that is easier said than done. The end decision of this issue eventually became reinforcing the Carapace Armor with additional plates of plasteel to enhance its defensive abilities. The Heavy Carapace Armor was introduced during the Battle of Coldharbour after the Fall of the Great Domain to mixed success.
		
This variant is marked for usage by Engineering staff.</vanillaDesc>

    <label>Officer Carapace Armor</label>
    <description>Carapace Armor comes in many shapes and sizes, this variant however was designed in the factories of the Deathworld of Fury. Despite the name, Fury is a highly organized society with a caste system which maintains a highborn nobility and a lowborn servile class. Often under siege by the Insectoid fleets, the Furian Guard is subject to the same stratification as their cities. As the Officers of the Furian Guard are found among the nobility, they have access to this specific armor. Reinforced with additional plasteel and adorned with gold filagree which offers both protection and proof of status.</description>

    <description>The most important part of any army is the ability to acquire intelligence on their enemies. The Vanguard Carapace Armor was designed on several planets though the most famous and its namesake would be by the Alexandrian Vanguard. During the First War of Alexandria against the Mechanoids, the most important factor in combat was speed. While not being heavy standard Carapace Armor is bulky and could be lightened. The Vanguard did so through removal of the shoulder plates and the “shaving” of certain areas until it only protected the chest of the wearer.</description>

Built to the same standard of Carapace Armor, which allows protection but has the trade-off of heavy equipment slowing down soldiers, though the Dragonguard of Hastings preferred the heavy armor over nothing.</description>
