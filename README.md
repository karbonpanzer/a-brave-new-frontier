# A Brave New Frontier

## Overview
*A Brave New Frontier* is a spiritual successor to Shazbot’s Frontier Uniforms. It expands RimWorld’s gear roster with grounded sci-fi infantry equipment — filling the gap between flak and power armour with kit for regular human troops. 

**Design goals:**
- Mid-tier protection between flak and marine.
- Focus on line infantry and civilian clothing, not supersoldiers.
- Clean, vanilla-style art and silhouettes.
- Accessories and belts used sparingly for clarity.
- DLC-aware progression: extras for Royalty, Biotech, Odyssey.

## Current Scope
- Uniforms, helmets and armour for multiple biomes.
- Civilian hats and clothing for non-combat pawns.
- Light accessories like belts/webbing that add gameplay readability.
- Faction and scenario groundwork for a fuller “frontier” setting.

## Roadmap (High Level)
Work to date: most defs written; art assets/textures in progress.

- **Gasmask** – Base game toxic protection.  
- **Riot Kit** – Armour, helmet, belt for law/riot units.  
- **Psycher Kit** *(Royalty)* – Armour, headgear, staff for psycasters.  
- **Mechinator Kit** *(Biotech)* – Helmet, armour, webbing for mechanitors.  
- **Partisan Kit** – Padded uniform, slouch hat, webbing for guerillas.  
- **Melee Expansion** – Trench club & trench sword to fill melee gaps.  
- **Argonaut Kit** *(Odyssey)* – Vacsuit & helmet for spacer/void play.

All DLC-tied content uses conditional defs and fails gracefully if the DLC isn’t installed.
