A Brave New Frontier: Theme, Vision & Roadmap
What It Is

A Brave New Frontier is a spiritual successor to Shazbot’s Frontier Uniforms. It keeps the simple, readable art style and pushes a grounded sci-fi infantry fantasy. The focus is on gear for the regulars who sit between flak and power armor: heavy duty plated kit for line troops. Human. Mortal. Breakable. The goal is to fill the gap that vanilla leaves.

Design Pillars

Gap Tier: Protection that sits clearly between flak and power armor.

Line Infantry First: Uniforms, helmets, and plate for regular troops, not exosuit supersoldiers.

Vanilla-Leaning Art: Clean silhouettes and readable sprites inspired by the original Frontier style.

Civil + Military Wardrobe: Soldiers are not everyone. Colonies need hats and civilian clothing so they look like societies.

Accessories With Restraint: Bandoliers and pouches only where they add clarity and gameplay value.

DLC-Aware Progression: New items for Biotech, Royalty, and Odyssey rather than patch stubs only.

Scope Today

Armor, uniforms, helmets across multiple biomes and roles.

Hats and civilian clothing for non-combat pawns.

Selective accessories that support loadouts and readability.

Faction and starting scenario groundwork for a fuller frontier setting.
