# A Brave New Frontier

## Overview
*A Brave New Frontier* is a spiritual successor to Shazbot’s Frontier Uniforms. It expands RimWorld’s military gear with grounded sci-fi infantry equipment — filling the gap between flak and power armour with kit for regular human troops.

**Design goals:**
- Mid-tier protection between flak and marine.
- Focus on line infantry: uniforms, helmets, armour, belts and weapons.
- Clean, vanilla-style art and silhouettes.
- Accessories and belts used sparingly for clarity.
- DLC-aware progression: extras for Royalty, Biotech, Odyssey.

## Roadmap (High Level)
Most defs are written; art assets/textures are the main work left. All DLC-tied content uses conditional defs and fails gracefully if the DLC isn’t installed.

- **Gasmask** – Base-game toxic protection mask.
- **Riot Kit** – Armour, helmet, belt for law/riot units.
- **Psycher Kit** *(Royalty)* – Armour, headgear, staff for psycasters.
- **Mechinator Kit** *(Biotech)* – Helmet, armour, webbing for mechanitors.
- **Partisan Kit** – Padded uniform, slouch hat, webbing for irregulars.
- **Melee Expansion** – Trench club & trench sword to fill melee gaps.
- **Argonaut Kit** *(Odyssey)* – Vacsuit & helmet for spacer/void environments.
